Translation of the Japanese e-scanner mod. https://www57.atwiki.jp/cataclyj/pages/224.html

This mod needs Lua support.
Recent official build of C:DDA has no Lua support. Try [Official 0.D stable build](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/releases/tag/0.D) or [C:DDA Lua Extension](https://github.com/lispcoc/Cataclysm-DDA-luaex/releases/tag/luaex-8932).

Lets you convert books into digital form, which is obviously much easier to carry than several paper books.

How to use:
- Obtain e-tablet
- Obtain ebook scanner
- ???
- Profit.
